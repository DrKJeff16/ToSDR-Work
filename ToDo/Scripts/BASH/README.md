# BASH
All files here use the Bourne Again Shell; `/bin/bash`, to be precise.

## How To Run Bash Files.

If you want to run the BASH files in this folder, be weary of the following:
  - If it's on the ToDo folder, it's not a guarantee to run.
  - Always check the scripts' contents for commentaries to warn you about possible incompatibilities/errors. ***DO NOT RUN THEM BLINDLY***
  - All scripts use `/bin/bash`.

Now that we've cleared this out of the way:

To run files, you must first locate your file on your terminal. For example:
```
# Assuming you're on this very directory...
chmod u+x myscript.sh       # Grants executable permissions to your Script.
. myscript.sh               # The Script is executed.
```
