### Editing:
-  ***Re-Phrasing***
  - [126](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/126) - _"This service uses first-party cookies on you."_
  - [134](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/134) - _"This service can license your content to third parties."_
  - [183](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/183) - _"You maintain ownership of your Content."_
  - [195](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/195) - _"You can request access, correction and/or deletion of your data."_
  - [206](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/206) - _"This Service will give you prior notice before closing your account."_
  - [390](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/390) - _"This Service can use your suggestions without compensation to you."_
  - [385](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/385) - _"If you block trackers, your experience will not be impacted."_
  - [149](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/149) - _"Liabilities on behalf of this Service cannot exceed a certain amount or the fees you've paid."_
  - [373](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/373) - _"This service may use and/or share your location data."_
  - [151](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/151) - _"You have a limited amount of time to take legal action against this service."_
  - [120](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/120) - _"Users are not involved in (critical) changes to this service's Terms."_
-  ***Weight/Rating***
  - [161](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/161), [162](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/162) and [398](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/398)
    - Rating: **Neutral**.
    - Weight: 70.
    - Reason: _I believe Users need to be informed about a certain Service not granting them any refunds, and so a higher weight would make it mare visible._
  - [167](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/167)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 20.
    - Reason: _In reality many third parties have a legal basis to access your personal information, even though many of these may not have the best intentions or the best business practices..._
  - [239](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/239)
    - Rating: **Bad**
    - Weight: 80.
    - Reason: This is really bad, specially because it's private conversations we're talking about...
  - [336](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/336)
    - Rating: **Bad**.
    -Weight: 30.
    Reason: _While this is no good, it's pretty much common practice, and for most services you can opt out with relative ease._
  - [393](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/393)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 10.
    - Reason: _A "reasonable" government request, for the most part, falls ultimately under a Service's definition of "reasonable". While some Services may only respond to court orders and/or subpoenas, it really depends on the Service's jurisdiction and ethics, without mentioning its government's practices._
  - [176](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/176)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 25.
    - Reason: _While a minimum amount of logs are kept, said service will still keep your data on storage..._
