# Case Revision [12/12/2020]
This is my personal list for suggestions regarding the [Phoenix Site](https://edit.tosdr.org), its organization and its Ratings. This list is an in-depth analysis of each category on the Phoenix Site, with the intention to make it as transparent, comprehensive and informative as possible.

If you have any suggestions, feedback or ideas, don't hesitate to contact me or any other member of the ToS;DR Team!

## Topics
This section will be divided on categories, as there are many repeated points of change being made.
### New Topics
_New Topic(s) that could distinguish Cases much more efficiently._
- **Advertising**.
  - [211](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/211) - _Promotions still count as advertising, I'd argue._
  - [216](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/216)
  - [219](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/219)
  - [220](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/220)
  - [327](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/327)
  - [336](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/336)
### Topic Changes
_I'd suggest the following names for Topics, since what is inside them is, overall, what defines them_.
- [27](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/27)
  - Name: _"**Content Ownership**"_.
- [33](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/33)
  - Name: _"**Accessibility**"_.
- [36](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/36)
  - Name: _"**Data Transparency**"_.
- [37](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/37)
  - Name: _"**Waivers**"_.
- [42](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/37)
    - Name: _"**Binding Arbitration**"_.

## Cases
_This section will be divided on categories, as there are many repeated points of change being made_.
### Topic Switch:
_These Cases, I'd suggest, would be more appropriate if they were moved to the specified Topics_:
- [**[DEPRECATED]**](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/55)
  - [142](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/142)
  - [212](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/212)
- [**[Content]**](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/52)
  - [150](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/150)
  - [280](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/280)
  - [281](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/281)
  - [284](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/284)
  - [285](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/285)
  - [292](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/292)
- [**[Suspension & Censorship]**](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/47)
  - [156](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/156)
  - [330](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/330)
- [**[Anonymity]**](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/26)
  - [324](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/324)
- [**[Security]**](https://edit.tosdr.org/topics/50)
  - [291](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/291)
### Editing:
- ***Re-Phrasing***
  - [120](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/120): _"Users are not involved in (critical) changes to this service's Terms."_
  - [126](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/126): _"This service uses first-party cookies on you."_
  - [134](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/134): _"This service can license your content to third parties."_
  - [149](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/149): _"Liabilities on behalf of this Service cannot exceed a certain amount or the fees you've paid."_
  - [151](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/151): _"You have a limited amount of time to take legal action against this service."_
  - [183](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/183): _"You maintain ownership of your Content."_
  - [195](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/195): _"You can request access, correction and/or deletion of your data."_
  - [206](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/206): _"This Service will give you prior notice before closing your account."_
  - [373](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/373): _"This service may use and/or share your location data."_
  - [385](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/385): _"If you block trackers, your experience will not be impacted."_
  - [390](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/390): _"This Service can use your suggestions without compensation to you."_
- ***Weight/Rating***
  - [161](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/161), [162](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/162) and [398](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/398)
    - Rating: **Neutral**.
    - Weight: 70.
    - Reason: _I believe Users need to be informed about a certain Service not granting them any refunds, and so a higher weight would make it mare visible._
  - [167](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/167)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 20.
    - Reason: _In reality many third parties have a legal basis to access your personal information, even though many of these may not have the best intentions or the best business practices..._
  - [176](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/176)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 25.
    - Reason: _While a minimum amount of logs are kept, said service will still keep your data on storage..._
  - [239](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/239)
    - Rating: **Bad**
    - Weight: 80.
    - Reason: This is really bad, specially because it's private conversations we're talking about...
  - [336](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/336)
    - Rating: **Bad**.
    - Weight: 30.
    - Reason: _While this is no good, it's pretty much common practice, and for most services you can opt out with relative ease._
  - [393](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/393)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 10.
    - Reason: _A "reasonable" government request, for the most part, falls ultimately under a Service's definition of "reasonable". While some Services may only respond to court orders and/or subpoenas, it really depends on the Service's jurisdiction and ethics, without mentioning its government's practices._
### This Service
All of the following Cases have _"The service"_ written in them, but I'd argue switching to _"This service"_ could catch our users' attention much more efficiently, and could potentially inform them with much more success.
