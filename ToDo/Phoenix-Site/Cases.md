### Editing:
-  ***Re-Phrasing***
  - [183](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/183) - _"You maintain ownership of your Content."_
  - [390](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/390) - _"This Service can use your suggestions without compensation to you."_
  - [149](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/149) - _"Liabilities on behalf of this Service are limited by a maximum amount and/or the fees you've paid to the Service."_

  - [393](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/393)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 10.
    - Reason: _A "reasonable" government request, for the most part, falls ultimately under a Service's definition of "reasonable". While some Services may only respond to court orders and/or subpoenas, it really depends on the Service's jurisdiction and ethics, without mentioning its government's practices._
  - [176](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/176)
    - Rating: **Good**.
    - Weight: 25.
    - Reason: _While a minimum amount of logs are kept, _
