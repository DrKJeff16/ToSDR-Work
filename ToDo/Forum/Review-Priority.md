```
This is personal opinion that merely serves as pragmatic advice.
This is not legal advice, nor an enforcement!

## Priority List
When reviewing a Service, always review the Documents in the following order:

### Tier List
```
1. Terms of Service
2. Privacy Policy
3. Cookie Policy
4. Community Guidelines
5. Copyright Notice
6. GDPR/CCPA
   .
   .
   .
```

## Explanation
When reviewing Services, sometimes we get conflicting stuff arising between Documents. This happens (most of the time) because specific Notices talk about *specific stuff*, which may need different wordings for the same thing.

The purpose of the *two main* Agreements (ToS and PrivPol) are clear:
- ToS: Protects the Service.
- Privacy Policy: Protects (*well, in practice, only informs*) the User of the Service's products.

If other Documents exist for the Service you're reviewing, I'd recommend you took these as ***subsets/extensions*** of either of the two main ones.

For example:
- **For ToS**:
  - Copyright Notice
  - Disclaimers
  - Accesibility Notice
  - ...

- For PrivPol
   - GDPR/CCPA Compliance (AKA `Do Not Sell My Data`)
   - Cookie Policy
   - ...

That being said, the reason why it is important to get the ToS straight before anything else is due to *Law compliance*.

*Understanding what you can and cannot sue a company for will make you understand how truthful they may or may not be/why they are (not) so vague/dismissive on the rest of the documents!* (Among other stuff)

The ToS are, in general and in practice, the baseline for all legal proceedings, *including Data Processing*.

Of course this is up to debate, and I would like your opinions on this, as I'm not a legal expert.
I will be looking forward to your answers!
