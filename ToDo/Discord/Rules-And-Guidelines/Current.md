**Version 2**: (11/10/2020)
Welcome, @everyone!
```fix
This server is for Off-Topic discussion mainly. If you want to discuss a Class, Request a Service to be added, or other related topics, please use the forum: "https://forum.tosdr.org/". This is for our transparency and logging.
```

To give distinction between users (for identification mostly), the following roles exist; here we'll provide how each one is granted and what it stands for:
- @User: Could be a random lurker, or just a new user from the Forum. Generally said Role has a baseline access to this server, as its users aren't too active or are very new to the ToS;DR Community.
- @Contributor : This role is granted either to Users that become too active either on the Forum, GitHub Repository, the Phoenix Site or this server/the Matrix one.
- @Phoenix Curator: This role represents Curators from the Phoenix Site (https://edit.tosdr.org). These users are generally active, and have quite of experience regarding Services Review.
- @Developer: This role represents users active on the GitHub Repositories (https://github.com/tosdr). These users are the best to respond to general doubts regarding Programming, and the Behind-The-Scenes stuff on the Site.
- @ToS;DR Team: Members from The ToS;DR Team, users with this Role been granted the `Trust Level 4`  and/or `Leader` Badges on the Forum. These users have a vast experience, and are the lead on User Orientation, Administration and more.

We also have a dynamic **Three Warning** system for offences, divided into three roles that will be assigned in succession:
- @Tier 1 Warning Offender. *Some privileges revoked for 3 days.*
- @Tier 2 Warning   Offender. ***Many privileges revoked for 1 week***
- @TIER 3 WARNING  Offender. __***All privileges revoked for 2 weeks.***__
__***If there is another offense after a TIER 3 WARNING, The User will be BANNED.***__

__*Offenders will be given a Notice through DM's stating the reason for their penalty.*__
*If you believe you have been penalised unfairly, please message any @Moderator for an appeal through a DM. Your appeal will be analysed and discussed.*
Addendum: `The Three Warning system does not apply to the Matrix Community since roles are not as dynamic.`

Rules:
**The following philosophy has been adopted**: `Don't be a dick towards others.`, from which:
```diff
+ Content posted on the wrong Channel (e.g. Giving server feedback in the Programming channel) won't be penalised with anything greater than just a DM warning, unless done repeatedly.
+ No spam allowed. (Starts on Tier 2 Warning)
+ Repeated discriminatory, hateful and/or ill-intentioned content will be penalised with a Tier 2/Tier 3 Warning, depending on the severity of the offense and amount of parties affected.
- Unwarranted/unironic threats of violence will not be tolerated. The offender will be given a Tier 3 Warning, then banned if done again.
- Posting of illegal content (CP, Drug Dealing, Gore, Snuff, R4PE, etc.) is strictly forbidden and will result in an IMMEDIATE BAN + Being reported to the proper authorities without any exceptions.
```
If you have any feedback, you can talk in the #server-feedback channel for discussion! Your ideas will be credited properly in a Rules And Guidelines rework.

Thanks to @Select#5970, @Dad-E#8445 and @pederdm000#4372 for their respective contributions!
