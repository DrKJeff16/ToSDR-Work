**Version 1:(10/10/2020)**  **__[DEPRECATED]__**
Welcome, @everyone!
```fix
This server is for Off-Topic discussion mainly. If you want to discuss a Class, Request a Service, and other related topics, please use the forum: "https://forum.tosdr.org/". This is for our transparency and logging.
```
We have a dynamic **Three Warning** system for offences, divided into three roles that will be assigned in succession:

- @Tier 1 Warning Offender. *Some privileges revoked for 3 days.*
- @Tier 2 Warning   Offender. ***Many privileges revoked for 1 week***
- @TIER 3 WARNING  Offender. __***All privileges revoked for 1 month.***__
__***If there is another offense after a TIER 3 WARNING, The User will be BANNED.***__

__*Offenders will be given a Notice through DM's stating the reason for their penalty.*__
*If you believe you have been penalised unfairly, please message any @Moderator for an appeal through a DM. Your appeal will be analysed and discussed.*

Rules:
```diff
+ Content posted on the wrong Channel (e.g. Giving server feedback in the Programming channel) won't be penalised with anything greater than just a DM warning, unless done repeatedly.
+ No spam allowed. (Starts on Tier 2 Warning)
+ NSFW content posted outside the NSFW Category will result in a Tier 1 Warning.
+ Discriminatory, hateful and related content will be penalised with a Tier 2/Tier 3 Warning, depending on the gravity of the offense.
- Threats of violence are not tolerated. The offender will be given a Tier 3 Warning, then banned if done again.
- Posting of illegal content (CP, Drug Dealing, Gore, Snuff...) is strictly forbidden and will result in an IMMEDIATE BAN + Being reported to the proper authorities.
```

If you have any feedback, you can talk in the #server-feedback channel for discussion! Your ideas will be credited properly in a Rules And Guidelines rework.
