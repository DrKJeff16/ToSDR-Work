## Functionalities of the Site
### [Badges](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges)
Users are granted a badge each time they surpass a certain threshold (depending on each badge). There is a lot of badges to talk about, but right now we will be talking about the main ones:
  - [Trust Level](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels): These badges are a symbol for many things, but mainly _activity_ and/or _reliability_. There are ***Six*** levels currently:
    - Level 0 (**NO BADGE**): Default Trust Level for ***New*** Users. It grants no (significant) privileges.
    - [Level 1](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges/1/basic) (***Basic***): The User has been fairly active, so the baseline functionalities have been granted to the user.
    - [Level 2](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges/2/member) (***Member***): The User is quite active in comparison, so Level 1 limitations are extended and other functionalities are granted.
    - [Level 3](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges/3/regular) (***Regular***): The User is very active, supportive and well-known at this point. More functionalities are granted.
    - [Level 4](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges/4/leader) (***Leader***): The User is a staple from the community, well-known, and barely any topic goes without them noticing. It's the ultimate *Trust Level* granted by Discourse, and grants very powerful tools for the User. ***It comes with a LOT of responsibility***.
    - [ToS;DR Team](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges/107/tos-dr-team): A unique badge for every member from the [ToS;DR Team](https://tosdr.org/about.html). It grants a unique Watermark and good-looking designs for the User's profile, among Moderator/Admin permissions.
