## Functionalities of the Site
### [Badges](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges)
Users are granted a badge each time they surpass a certain threshold (depending on each badge). There is a lot of badges to talk about, but right now we will be talking about the main ones:
  - [Trust Level](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels): These badges are a symbol for many things, but mainly _activity_ and/or _reliability_. There are ***Six*** levels currently:
    - Level 0 (**NO BADGE**): Default Trust Level for ***New*** Users. It grants no privileges.
    - [Level 1](https://forum.tosdr.org/badges/1/basic) (***Basic***): The User has been fairly active, so the baseline functions have been granted to the user.
